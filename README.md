# Arduino Racer Game
Hello! Welcome to my arduino racer game!

## How does it work?
To see this game in action, please refer to [ArduinoRacerGame](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k33dsCOmEvw&ab_channel=Suki).

Essentially, the game starts with a car being representing as a ***D***. At first the game is slow, and the player's objective is to dodge the
incoming obstacles, represented as ***0*** characters. 

## Controls
On the breadboard, you will see three buttons.

The leftmost buttom will move the car to the top row.
The middle button will move the car to the bottom.
The rightmost buttom will restart the game.
