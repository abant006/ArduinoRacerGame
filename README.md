# Arduino Racer Game
Hello! Welcome to my arduino racer game!

## How does it work?
To see this game in action, please refer to [ArduinoRacerGame](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k33dsCOmEvw&ab_channel=Suki).

Essentially, the game starts with a car being representing as a ***D***. At first the game is slow, and the player's objective is to dodge the
incoming obstacles, represented as ***0*** characters.  

## Controls
On the breadboard, you will see three buttons.  

The leftmost buttom will move the car to the top row.  
The middle button will move the car to the bottom.  
The rightmost buttom will restart the game.  

## Gameplay  
As mentioned above, the objective of the game is to dodge any incoming obstacles.  
Please be wary that as the game progresses, it **WILL** become increasingly faster.

## Ending  
When you hit an obstacle ending the game, you will notice that the screen will freeze for a few seconds. Following this freeze, the screen will
show the score you accumulated during the game phase.
